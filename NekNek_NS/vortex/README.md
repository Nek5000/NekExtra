This is the vortex breakdown in a container with rotating lid. The mesh has
been generated by clipping the monodomain mesh (vortexl.rea for the lower half
and vortexu.rea for the upper half). 

1. A stretching factor is applied in usrdat2 to ensure that the interface
boundaries are not exactly over the edge of the first element in the
overlapping domain. 

2. ngeom=2 and ninter=1 is sufficient for this case since we are going to
let the flow develop to steady-state (T=2000).

3. Axial velocity profile along the centerline of the cylinder is output at
iostep.  The user can extract the most recent velocity profiles:

     grep vortex_vz s00000_logfile | awk '{print $4 " " $5}' | tail -1000 > vzldata.out
 
     grep vortex_vz s00001_logfile | awk '{print $4 " " $5}' | tail -1000 > vzudata.out

   and then plot them in gnuplot:
   
     plot "vzldata.out" u 1:2 w l;replot "vzudata.out" u 1:2 w l
