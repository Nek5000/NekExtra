This directory contains three examples demonstrating convergence to 
Kovasznay's exact solution for the 2D steady Stokes and Navier-Stokes
equations.  A brief description is provided in kovasznay.pdf.

The cases are the following:

k40_std -- Re=40: time-marching
k40     -- Re=40: time-marching with user-provided evaluation of nonlinear terms
k00     -- Re= 0: steady-state Uzawa scheme (works only for PN-PN-2 formulation).

Here, time-marching implies that Nek5000 uses time advancement to evolve the
solution to the steady state.  Starting with an initial condition of (u,v)=(0,0),
the solution reaches the target discretization error in about 4 to 5 convective
time units.  Here, the solution convergenes on a convective, rather than diffusive,
timescale because the error is advected out of the domain boundary.  Typical error
levels are ~ 1.e-5--1.e-6 for N=7 (i.e., lx1=8) and ~ 1.e-12 for N=17 (lx1=18).

To see the error, just type

grep err logfile

Time is given in column 7 and errors (H1, H1-seminorm, L2, and L_infinity)
are given in columns 3--6.  Polynomial order is in column 2 and timestep
number is in column 1.

To run different polynomial orders, simply edit SIZE and change lx1, following
standard Nek5000 practice.   Note, because of CFL stability considerations,
you may have to reduce DT (param 12 in the .rea file) if you significantly
increase lx1 for the time-marching cases.
